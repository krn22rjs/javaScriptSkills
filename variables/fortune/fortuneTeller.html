<h1> The fortune Teller </h1>

<h2>Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?</h2>
<p>
Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
   // variables
  var numKids = 4;
  var pName = "Mark Darcy";
  var city = "London";
  var jobTitle = "Web Developer";

  // creating a variable future as a  string 

  var future = "You will be " + jobTitle + " in " + location + ", and be married to " + pName + " with " + numKids + " kids.";

  //console.log the future
  console.log(future);
  </script>
